        Last week, during a 1 on 1 with my coworker, we started talking about objective functions in life, systems for decision making, and brought up the 37% rule from the book <em>Algorithms to Live By</em>. Since then, I've been asking myself: what are the rules or principles I try to apply in my life so far? In this post, I’m compiling some of the ones I try to live by. I’ve loosely grouped them by themes for better readability!
      </p>

      <br>
      <h2>Decision Making & Mental Clarity</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>
          <strong>The 37% Rule</strong><br>
          Spend the first 37% of your decision making window exploring options, then choose the next one that’s better than everything you've seen so far. It’s useful framework for situations like job hunts or apartment searches—especially when you're unsure what you want. That said, it’s not meant to be followed blindly. Like many algorithmic rules, it’s most powerful when balanced with intuition and your own sense of timing.<br>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The Time Horizon Rule</strong><br>
            Ask yourself: How will I feel about this in a few minutes? A few months? A few years? At the end of my life? This simple shift helps you zoom out and put your choices into perspective, especially when emotions are running high. I use it for key decisions in my life, but also for figuring out wether or not to buy certain things.<br>

          </li>
        <li>
          <strong>First Principles Thinking</strong><br>
          Break problems into their fundamental truths and reason up from there. Great for innovation and problem solving.<br>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reframing</strong><br>
          How you interpret a situation influences your emotional response. Reframing helps reduce stress and increase control.<br>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multiple Perspectives Rule</strong><br>
          Most disagreements aren’t about truth vs. lie. They’re about different lived experiences. Be aware of biases.<br>

          <strong>好记性不如烂笔头 (A good memory is not as reliable as a lousy pen)</strong><br>

            <strong>Internal Family Systems</strong><br>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin: 1rem 0;">----------</p>
      <p>As I was organizing these, a few things came to mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My worldview is shaped and limited by my own experience. It's bounded by the three languages I speak and the three cultures I'm familiar with. I'm grateful to have been raised across different cultures, and I also wonder what I would be like if I was raised and borned in completely different environment.</li>
        <li>Experience matters, but it's not enough. What really counts is how openly we experience. If I were a machine learning model, new data would only be useful if it actually updated my parameters. Otherwise, it's just noise.</li>
        <li>Many ideas are just variations on the same wisdom. James Clear’s 1% rule, for example, is basically the Chinese saying: “Dripping water wears through stone.”</li>
      </ul>
    <br>  
<p>That last point makes me wonder: what the heck is originality? Much of what we call “original” is just remixing and resurfacing of ancient truths in modern form. Many pop psychology books are essentially old proverbs translated into a different language, wrapped in fresh stories and backed by neuroscience or some case studies. It’s not that the insights are new; it’s that they’re made newly legible to us.</p>

<p>And perhaps that’s the difference between math and life advice. In mathematics, theorems are precise and universal. They’re often named after their discoverers because they can’t be restated without preserving their form. Math is a rigorous language—one concept, one structure, no ambiguity. But human language, and life itself, is messier. A single idea can wear a thousand faces, depending on who’s speaking and who’s listening.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s why life wisdom isn’t owned but shared. Passed down, picked up, forgotten, remembered, reworded. And that’s kind of beautiful. The value isn’t just in discovering new truths, but in reconnecting with old ones at the right time, in the right voice. We don’t need brand new rules. We need reminders that land.</p>

<p>So if a rule resonates with you, use it. Make it yours. Call it by whatever name helps it stick. Because whether it comes from a Zen monk, a stoic emperor, a random dude on the internet, or your coworker on a Tuesday, the wisdom is still good. It’s not about where it came from. It’s about whether it helps you live a better life.</p>

<p> With that, I end with a extremely weeby gif from My Hero Academia, showing how the power of One For All is passed down from generation to generation—each successor adding their strength, making it more powerful over time. To me, it’s a perfect symbol of human progress: wisdom accumulated, reshaped, and carried forward, growing stronger with each handoff.</p>
