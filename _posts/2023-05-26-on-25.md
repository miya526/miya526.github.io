So I recently started watching an anime called [Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zom_100:_Bucket_List_of_the_Dead). It's about this dude named Akira working for what we call a [burakku kigyō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_company) (a company that works your ass off). But here's the twist: one fine morning, Akira wakes up to a world where people are turning into zombies. And he's actually stoked about it, because no work and everyone turning into zombies mean he can start living life like there's no tomorrow. So, he creates a bucket list called '100 Things I Want to do Before I Become a Zombie' to give his newfound freedom some purpose.

Watching the anime really made me think about what it means to live life to the fullest for me. Throughout our formative years, we navigate the education system, striving for higher grades and following a predetermined path. We work tirelessly in high school to secure a place in college, then invest ourselves in college to secure a job. Afterward, we often rush into marriage, homeownership, and parenthood, all the while adhering to societal expectations. Is this scripted life journey truly what we desire? What do we truly want to do?

Now, it's not easy to ponder these questions with all the noise from the world and the pressure to conform. Money, status, stability – they're all in the mix. But when you face the reality that life has an expiration date, things get real. Then, a more straightforward question to ask is: what would you do if you knew you had just one more day, a week, a month, a year, or a decade? When you seriously chew on those questions, all those daily worries start looking like small potatoes. Priorities shift, and you suddenly realize there's a whole list of stuff you really want to do, things you want to experience. It's like hitting the reset button on life and living for yourself.

I decided to take on the challenge and ask myself these very questions. It's an uncomfortable process, but with each step, I uncover a little more about myself, my values, and my desires. So, inspired by Akira's quest for a more fulfilling existence,, I started jotting down my own bucket list, and I recommend you do the same! Here's my ever-evolving list:
