      Hey there, I'm Allen and this is where I share thoughts and learnings (when I remember). I'm impressed you found this tucked away spot on the internet!
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
      I was born in Japan, raised mostly in China, and moved to New York for high school. I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science from UCLA, and now I'm living and working in the Bay Area. I speak English, Chinese, and some Japanese, which has allowed me to develop an international perspective on things and opened up different opportunities.    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
    For work, I mostly do ML/AI stuff. Right now, I lead the ML side of FB Profile, where we work on RecSys, Search/Typeahead and collaborate with many teams including ads, newsfeed, etc to improve the FB ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
      Before that, I worked on ads at TikTok, where I was responsible for manual targeting products—like age/gender, interests, etc.—and also worked on auto-targeting and improving ads retrieval and ranking.
    Before that, I worked on fraud/integrity ML at Mercari, using ML to prevent bad things from happening, and worked on various ML and product initiatives at startup.
