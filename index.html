      Hey there, I'm Allen and this is where I share thoughts and learnings (when I remember). I'm impressed you found this tucked away spot on the internet!
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
      I was born in Japan, raised mostly in China, and moved to New York for high school. I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science from UCLA, and now I'm living and working in the Bay Area. I speak English, Chinese, and some Japanese, which has allowed me to develop an international perspective on things and opened up different opportunities.    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
      For work, I mostly focus on ML/AI. Right now, I lead the ML side of FB Profile, where we work on various features on the profile surface and partner with multiple teams to improve experiences across Newsfeed, PYMK, Search/Typeahead, Notifications, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
      Before that, I worked on ads at TikTok, where I was responsible for manual targeting products—like age/gender, interests, etc.—and also worked on auto-targeting and improving ads retrieval and ranking.
    Before that, I worked on fraud/integrity ML at Mercari, using ML to prevent bad things from happening, and worked on various ML and product initiatives at startup.
