      Hey there, I'm Allen and this is where I share thoughts and learnings (when I remember). I'm impressed you found this tucked away spot on the internet!
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
      I was born in Japan, raised mostly in China, and moved to New York for high school. I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science from UCLA, and now I'm living and working in the Bay Area. I speak English, Chinese, and some Japanese, which has allowed me to develop an international perspective on things and opened up different opportunities.    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
      For work, I do mostly ML/AI stuff. Right now, I work on recsys at Meta. Before that, I worked on ads targeting/recsys at TikTok, fraud/risk/integrity ml at Mercari, various ML and product initiatives at startup, etc.
