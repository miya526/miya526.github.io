<p>Hey there, I&#39;m Allen and this is where I share thoughts and learnings from my life. </p>
<p>I was born in Japan, then grew up mostly in China. I moved to the US in high school and got my Bachelor&#39;s and Master&#39;s in Computer Science from UCLA. Now, I&#39;m living and working in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>For work, I do mostly ML/AI stuff. Right now, I work on profile ranking at Meta. Before that, I worked on ads targeting and recommendation at TikTok, fraud prevention and modeling at Mercari, etc.</p>
